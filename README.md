# python_converter_2.x_to_3.x
make a 'mydir' folder under the same repo where the python_file_converter_2-x_to_3-x.py lies and copy all the test python files under the 'mydir' folder and run the python_file_converter_2-x_to_3-x.py file.

It will convert the python 2.x files into python 3.x file

***This will solve the print issue with 2.x. If some other portability problems comes then you have to solve the problem manually.***
